            <p class="grey-text text-darken-2 pb20">This is the first time in Romania that an NGO is building a hospital
                from scratch, only out of donations and sponsorships.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-2 pb20">Seeing as the State hasn't built anything related to Pediatric Oncology
                for 50 years, the Dăruiește Viață Association has taken on the mission of building the FIRST Pediatric
                Oncology, Radiotherapy and Trauma hospital in Romania, meant to offer multidisciplinary care to children
                with serious diseases, at West-European standards.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-2 pb20">Our project started in 2015 with our wish to improve the treatment
                conditions in the Pediatric Oncology department of the "Marie Curie" Hospital in Bucharest. In here, 30
                kids and 30 grown-ups have to share two toilets at the end of the hallway and only one shower. As the
                old infrastructure of the building wouldn't allow us to add individual bathrooms to the wards, we
                decided to build a new clinic from scratch, with three floors that would only host the Oncology
                department.</p>
            <p class="grey-text text-darken-2 pb20">The needs of the medical team and the incredible mobilization of our
                donors allowed us to expand the project. This way, what was initially supposed to be only a clinic
                turned into a full-blown hospital - the first Pediatric Oncology and Radiotherapy Hospital in Romania.
                This meant a building of approximately 12.000 sqm, 9 levels and about 200 beds. Read more on <a
