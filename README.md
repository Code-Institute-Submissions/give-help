> ## UX

### Project goals
The main purpose for which I thought this website is to make known the approach of an NGO in Romania which, despite all the problems encountered, with the participation of an important component of civil society, manages to build from scratch a multidisciplinary hospital dedicated to children who suffers from cancer.

Their approach is absolutely extraordinary and I considered that I can make a small contribution by promoting their cause and at the same time to fulfill the requirements of this project.

### Audience goals
The target user of this website is any internet user who could get involved in this case in different ways. I created this website considering the main goals that a potential user would like to achieve, namely:
* to find out details about this campaign started by an NGO;
* to get involved in supporting the campaign by making a donation through a payment with a bank card;
* to get involved in supporting the campaign by making a donation by buying products displayed in the online store;
* to see images with the stage of the evolution of the construction of this hospital and images of what this hospital will look like and what facilities it will have;
* to be able to create an account on this website;
* to be able to modify his personal details from the account profile;
* to have the technical possibility to request the reset of the password in case he doesn't remember it;
* to be able to subscribe to receive a newsletter with news regarding this humanitarian campaign.

### Website owner goals
As I mentioned above, the main goal for which, as an owner, I made this website, was to make known the approach of an NGO in Romania which, despite all the problems encountered, with the participation of an important component of civil society, manages to build from scratch a multidisciplinary hospital dedicated to children who suffers from cancer.

### Strategy
We wanted this project to be a platform that facilitates the satisfaction of the needs of both the beneficiary, through the possibility of collecting donations in order to reach the assumed target, that of building a hospital but also of the users of this website who would like to get involved in supporting this cause. The whole project provides basic functionalities in order to function optimally and achieve the goal, but in the future, other functionalities can be thought of and added.

### Scope
The main purpose is to facilitate the connection between a non-governmental organization, a non-profit association and potential users who can get involved in supporting the cause through direct or indirect donations.

### Structure
As a structure, I could say that the website has three major components, a component through which the user can make a donation. A second component is the management of personal data by creating an account. A third component is the story of this campaign created by Asiciatia Daruieste Viata din Romania.

### Skeleton
The three components mentioned above can in turn be divided into several functionalities. A component through which the user can make a donation both through a payment with a credit card and through the purchase of gifts from the online store. A second component is the management of personal data by creating an account. The user is thus able to register his personal data, to modify them, to be able to make a request to reset the access password. A third component is the story of this campaign created by Asiciatia Daruieste Viata din Romania, the user can find out details about the project, view photos, access external resources where they can find more information, subscribe to a newslatter to be up to date with the evolution of the campaign.

### Surface
The color palette used in the design of this website was determined with Adobe Color and is not accidental, using the color gray, which symbolizes less pleasant things, suffering in the case of small beneficiaries of this cause, and inserts of strong shades of yellow and orange that suggest hope, the sun and its healing power.
