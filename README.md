> ## UX

### Project goals
The main purpose for which I thought this website is to make known the approach of an NGO in Romania which, despite all the problems encountered, with the participation of an important component of civil society, manages to build from scratch a multidisciplinary hospital dedicated to children who suffers from cancer.

Their approach is absolutely extraordinary and I considered that I can make a small contribution by promoting their cause and at the same time to fulfill the requirements of this project.

### Audience goals
The target user of this website is any internet user who could get involved in this case in different ways. I created this website considering the main goals that a potential user would like to achieve, namely:
* to find out details about this campaign started by an NGO;
* to get involved in supporting the campaign by making a donation through a payment with a bank card;
* to get involved in supporting the campaign by making a donation by buying products displayed in the online store;
* to see images with the stage of the evolution of the construction of this hospital and images of what this hospital will look like and what facilities it will have;
* to be able to create an account on this website;
* to be able to modify his personal details from the account profile;
* to have the technical possibility to request the reset of the password in case he doesn't remember it;
* to be able to subscribe to receive a newsletter with news regarding this humanitarian campaign.
